--------------------------------------------------
So informative, I now understand what features are most important for predicting my target value
you can clearly see that vote count and budget are really important and the others less. the right graph is not clear.
i understand that the vote count is the most important feature, budget is quite important and then the other are less important. also, when you have 2 features, we can very precise, and when we add more we dont get a lot more info.
i thought that the information in the graph is not accurate, but if it is true than the graph reflects the corolation clearly.
the most important features are vote count and budget, the other ones are less important. in the right graph, 2 features might be enough
i understand whats going on, i like the left graph more
the plot is ok, i can understand the importance of each feature and the commulative help understanding.
looking good. i can understand that with only 2 features we can get a very good revenue.
i can understand that the vote count has the biggest impact on the revenue.


Plot Number: 1
--------------------------------------------------
This is an amazing graph that explains the distibution of my target variable. This is a crutial step in understanding the dataset!
we have very little movies with high revenue, lots of movies have low revenue.
i understand that most movies crate a low revenue.
i can understand where most movies are, helps a lot. not in the prediction.
also very nice. i can see that the data ditribution is not normal, and that there are a lot of movies with lower revenue.
we can understand what are the most important features an dhow many features we need.
it helped me understand the ditribution of the data.


Plot Number: 10
--------------------------------------------------
same
good graph
same as before
the Hezion is so different that I am so amazed about it
the connection is not intersting.
also here but this one is less informative.


Plot Number: 11
--------------------------------------------------
same as before
same here! amazing how the p value is low and the Hezion is diif
this graph is fine. if the cast is lower than 75 people then the revenue will be low.
this is very interesting. i can see that there is a differnce in mocies that are not western, as time grows we have much less movies that are western.
as the last one, its nice
there is no need to take a lot of crew members


Plot Number: 12
--------------------------------------------------
same
same as before
ive seen this grph alredy. interesting corrolation.
same as before
also
like the revenue
this is not relevant.


Plot Number: 13
--------------------------------------------------
i dont want to see more outlires but it's interesting
the more crue the less revenue from more income.
worse
i am so sick of it !!!
as before
same as cast
this is also nice. the number of movies in war is growing.
when i have less crew i get more votes


Plot Number: 14
--------------------------------------------------
this is the same everywhere
same as before
X^2 is so interesting :)
as before
there is not intersting connection here.


Plot Number: 2
--------------------------------------------------
This is the correlation between one of the two most important features for predicting the revenue. this is so informative!
The graph is clear though you could augment the data to fit the screen better.
there is a relation between the budget and vote count, and the ones that are above it are the outliers.
really informative i could understand everything i wanted to
the graph is good, most movies dont have revenue that is above 100m revenue
i see a linear connection, when the budget is higher the revenue is also, helps a lot. how the data looks.
i undestand the distribution of the target variable.
i understand there a lot of red dots.


Plot Number: 3
--------------------------------------------------
This graph shows the corelation between revenue feature and the no. 1 most effective feature in predicting it. Awesome!
I can undersanf where the outlires of the features begin
there is a positive correlation between the budget and revenue, there are some outliers that are logical.
very little movies has big revenue, most movies are at about 0.2 revenue.
this helps me to understand how the data is actually is
there is a high correlation between the features
that a really good one, i can see that th correlation between budget and revenue is very high, the higher the budget the higher the revenue.
when we have a higher buget, the revenueu is higher.


Plot Number: 4
--------------------------------------------------
This graph is less informative becuase those are not relations i'm interested in
This graph is pretty clear, I can understand the correlation
i see there is a positive corrolation between revenue and vote count. it is logical because more revenue = more watchers = more votes.
this helps me to predict the revenue as func of the amount of budget
i see that movies with high votecount has better revenue
best one so far. the feature is very relevent, and the correlation is high and interesting. what the crowd likes more there is probably a higher revenue, liked the corr value.
very important. there are a lot of outliers.


Plot Number: 5
--------------------------------------------------
Same, this is interesting and informative
when a movie has a higher budget, the revenue is higher.
same
dosent give a lot of information.
also here. super good!
most movies that are not animated are not for family. most movies for families are animated
that is also very good, you can see that there is a high correlation between the revenue and the vote count.
here the correlation is even better. it also makes sense, if the movie was good there is a lot of voters, then the revenue is higher.
when there is a higher vote count, the revenue is higher.


Plot Number: 6
--------------------------------------------------
interesting display of the outlires!
extremely clear, i understand the relation between animation and family films
when more people rate the movie, the revenue is higher. the trend line dosent really help. therer is a big mass of data that makes it harder to see the connections.
it gives me information of the data, shows correlation. animation and family i can see the connection.
less interesting. the trend line is less understandable.
when therer is 75 in the case and 125 in the crew we have outliers


Plot Number: 7
--------------------------------------------------
same as before
i can understand the boundries of the outliers.
i dont like thi sgraph. cant take a lot of information from it. dont know how to read it. the revenue is proprtional to the cast size. the outliers dont give me a lot of info.
same here. really good.
the left graph alone is not good, but with the right one its nice. might have been enough to show only the right one.
that is also good, the correlation between vote count and budget is very high, might think to put them together.
the 2 features are not so releveant, but the graph is cool.
this is nive, i understand we may not need a very large crew


Plot Number: 8
--------------------------------------------------
same, but i saw 3 of these already
as before, you can deduce the boundries, and you can see that there is a lot of mass at the begining of the plot.
didnt like the graph type but i understand that collections recieve more revenue.
very similar to the last grpah. when there is more cast members, we have more votes.
cast with size of 25-50 has smaller revenue. when i have higher cast, i get higher rvenue but this is an outlier.
we can see that the median, and the max is much higher wheh a movie is belong to some collection, very interestings.
this is more interesting because this is related to the revenue. when we have higher cast we are probably in an outlier.


Plot Number: 9
--------------------------------------------------
same
this is clear and informative
same as before
i dont see a linear relation, but i understand that most movies dont hire a lot of cast and crew.
same as the last plot. the revenue is not that dependenet on the revenue value. dont like the outliers
i see that there is a correletion between the cast and the crew. the outliers helped.
also same here
not interesting.
less cast is better votes . interesting
